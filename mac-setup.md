# Mac Dev Setup

### Set up Homebrew
First thing is to set up Homebrew to install some of the other programs through the terminal. The thing that kept throwing me off when I first started installing Homebrew was that it would give me an error of `zsh:command not found: brew` upon further investigation, I was missing a critical step on reading the last two lines that Hombrew would give me after the install in the terminal. 

A good reference is [Install Homebrew](https://mac.install.guide/homebrew/3) by the Mac Install Guide

### Install Git using Homebrew
Git is typically installed as part of Xcode Command Line Tool, but installing through Homebrew often provides a more up-to-date version of Git compared to Xcode Command Line Tools. 
You can install Git by running `brew install git`.
